        <h1><strong><center>Ukrainian Crisis</center></strong></h1>
        <h2><center>By Gus Kirkpatrick</center></h2>

        <p>On the 24th of February in 2022, Vladimir Putin made the executive decision that Russia would invade Ukraine. While the official number is disputed, as of May 10th, over 3,000 innocent Ukrainian civilians have perished while thousands more suffered severe injuries. And as if that isn’t enough, over 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed. There are several reasons Putin made the decision to attack Ukraine, all of which pertaining to the longstanding tension between the countries. Putin has stated his goal was to “demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine” in addition to “ensuring Ukraine’s neutral status.” Despite many viewing this attack as one of the biggest European wars in decades, Putin refuses to classify it as a war, referring to it only as a “special military operation.” This is not the first time Russia has invaded Ukraine, as back in 2014, Putin invaded Eastern Ukraine resulting in the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, thus giving Russia control over it. Fast forward to the present day, it is reported that Russia has conquered much of Eastern Ukraine. Both in 2014 and 2022, Putin is on record to defend his decision by saying Ukraine was a threat as they demonstrated Western ideals and prevented Russia from feeling “safe, developing, and existing.” </p>
        <p>However, this claim seems very suspicious considering the sheer size of the Russian military compared to that of Ukraine. Russia boasts an active military personnel of 850,000. This is over four times the size of Ukraines active military personnel of roughly 200,000. In fact, the Russian military trumps Ukraines in every single aspect. The chart below illustrates the utter dominance and superiority Russia has over Ukraine. </p>

        <iframe title="Russia vs. Ukraine Military Capacities" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-eKnTd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eKnTd/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="563"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
        
        <p>However the chart does not tell the entire story, as many countries such as the United States under Joe Biden have stepped in to give Ukraine much needed help. For example, according to the Bureau of Political Military affairs, America alone has aided Ukraine with over 4.5 billion dollars of security assistance including 11 Mi-17 helicopters, over 50,000,000 rounds of ammunition, and 200 M113 Armored Personnel Carriers. Moreover, just recently, according to Peter Baker and Emily Cochrane of the New York Times, President Biden proposed to send over 30 billion dollars worth of military and humanitarian aid. </p>
        <p>Despite all of the aid Ukraine is receiving, life in parts of Ukraine remains so unimaginable and dangerous to the point where Ukrainian citizens are leaving the country at a record setting rate. As you can see below, in the 23 days between February 24th and March 18th, over 2.8 million refugees fled Ukraine. This is an astronomically high number, and when this refugee crisis is put into perspective with others, only proves to be even more ridiculous. The chart below portrays the multiple different refugee crises from Venezuela in 2017 to Rwanda in 1993 to Iraq in 2005. However, the chart represents the accumulated number of refugees in each of these respective situations over an entire year while Ukrainian data was taken over the course of less than a month. </p>

        <iframe title="The Massive Impact of Russia's Invasion on Ukrainian Refugees" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-rRnrr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rRnrr/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="507"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

        <p>This seems almost incomprehensible, but when you truly understand the gravity of the situation, it becomes apparent why so many Ukrainian’s left the country. For citizens living in Eastern Ukraine, it is simply not an option to stay home as Russia is applying constant military pressure on the East. Towns and villages are getting blown to bits, lit on fire, and shot up on a daily basis. In reality, the only reason one would stay would be to fight for Ukraine and defend their land. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, stated in a press conference, “We will not give up, and we will not lose, we will fight till the end, at sea, in the air, we will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.” Ukrainian troops and authorities have gained massive respect from people all around the country for their will to fight in the face of heavy adversity. However those who choose to flee must find a new place to reside.</p>
        <p>The refugees are dispersing all around. As of May 5th, Poland alone has taken in over 3 million Ukrainian refugees while over 800,000 have fled to Romania and over 500,000 to Hungary. Many of these host countries have been very hospitable, giving Ukrainian refugees money for food and providing foldable beds for shelter.</p>

        <p>Robert Reich, a former tennis club coach from northern New Jersey knows what it’s like to be a refugee. Reich is originally from Germany, and had the unfortunate experience of living amidst the reign of Hitler.<p>
        <p>When he was just 21 years old, he boarded a ship from Germany to New York by himself to start a new life, away from all the tragedy in Germany. Reich said, “it’s not as if I wanted to leave my family and friends at home, it was really my only option. It wasn’t safe to stay home, there was danger every day.” It seems as if Ukrainian refugees are enduring a similar situation. Reich says, “What’s going on in Ukraine and Russia right now is just awful. It is no way to live and I pray things get better.” Reich discussed the hardships that came with being a refugee, as he didn’t see his family in person for over fifteen years. He says, “I know what they are going through and let me tell you it is not easy, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy.”<p>
        <p>As Russia continues to attack and move east while Ukraine attempts to hold their ground with the help of NATO, there is not a clear end to the war in sight. Though for the sake of every man, woman and child involved, many are praying for the end to come sooner rather than later.<p>
